P2T LoRA Decoder — Stage 3 Option 5: LLM-Based Error Classification
====================================================================
Implements "Option 5: LLM-Based Error Classification" from the "P2T
Three-Stage Error Analysis Framework" (P2T Error Pattern Analysis V1.pdf).
The framework's own worked example (verbatim, p.5-6 of the PDF):

    Prompt:
        Ground Truth: I see the problem.
        Prediction: I sea the problem.

        Classify the error as
        1. Phonological
        2. Lexical
        3. Contextual
        4. Semantic

        Explain why.

    Output:
        Category: Lexical
        Subcategory: Homophone
        Explanation: The predicted word is a homophone of the correct
        word but changes the lexical choice.

This is the module check_grammar() in contextual_analysis.py escalates
to when it returns resolved=False — either because the substitution
involves an open-class homophone (see/sea: not a closed-class word at
all) or a closed-class word whose dependency role doesn't reliably
distinguish correct from incorrect usage (there/too/two: see that
module's docstring). An LLM judge can use full sentence context (and,
in principle, surrounding-sentence context) to make the lexical vs.
contextual vs. semantic call that pure syntax can't.

ONE ADDITION BEYOND THE PDF'S LITERAL PROMPT
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The PDF shows the desired Category/Subcategory/Explanation output as a
worked example, not as an explicit instruction inside the prompt. A
0.5B-1B instruct model run zero-shot won't reliably reproduce that
exact structure without being told to. _build_prompt() below adds one
line -- "Respond in exactly this format:" followed by the three labelled
fields -- so _parse_response() can extract structured fields
automatically across many sentence pairs. The four-option classification
list and "Explain why." instruction are verbatim from the PDF; only the
output-format instruction is this module's own addition, and it's kept
as a clearly separate, minimal scaffold rather than rewording anything
the PDF specifies.

SCOPE LIMITATION: SENTENCE-LEVEL CONTEXT ONLY, NOT PARAGRAPH-LEVEL
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Earlier in this project's methodology discussion, Option 5 was
recommended specifically because an LLM judge can reason at the
paragraph level, not just the sentence level (unlike Option 3's
grammar check, which is inherently sentence-bound). That reach requires
actually passing surrounding-sentence context into the prompt. This
project's real dataset (sentphonemepairs_LRS2_original.csv) has only
two columns -- sentence text and phoneme transcription -- with no
video-id, clip-sequence, speaker-id, or timestamp column to verify
which sentences are contiguous/from the same discourse. Treating
adjacent CSV rows as a paragraph would be an unverified assumption, not
a finding, so classify_error() below deliberately takes only a single
(ground_truth, prediction) pair: it gets Option 5's better single-
sentence reasoning (full clause/sentence structure, not just local
dependency roles), but NOT genuine cross-sentence discourse reasoning.
If a verified paragraph/discourse grouping becomes available upstream
of this CSV, classify_error() would need a third "Context:" field
added to the prompt -- the signature is intentionally narrow so that
doesn't get silently faked.

EMPIRICAL FINDING: THE CPU DRY-RUN JUDGE MODEL IS NOT RELIABLE (25 Jun 2026)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran this module's own smoke test against the cached MODEL_NAME_DRYRUN
(Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct). The prompt/parsing pipeline itself worked --
every call returned a cleanly-parsed Category/Subcategory/Explanation,
no "Unparseable" results. But the *classifications were wrong*,
including on the PDF's own two canonical worked examples:
  - "I see the problem" -> "I sea the problem" should be Lexical /
    Homophone (the PDF's own stated answer). The 0.5B model said
    Semantic, and its explanation hallucinated a different sentence
    ("I see the issue") that was never in the prompt.
  - "Yesterday I went home" -> "Yesterday I will go home" should be
    Contextual / Tense inconsistency (the PDF's own Option 3 example).
    The 0.5B model again said Semantic.
  - Both project-data examples (CHIP->SHIP near-homophone,
    CHIP->BANANA unrelated substitution) were also called Semantic.
All four cases got the same label. This looks like the 0.5B model
defaulting to "Semantic" as a safe-seeming guess rather than actually
discriminating between the four categories -- consistent with this
project's standing finding that small CPU stand-in models are useful
for exercising a pipeline's *shape*, not for trusting their outputs
(same caveat already on record for the dry run's decoder itself).
**Don't trust Option-5 category labels produced by the CPU dry-run
judge model.** This module's plumbing (prompt, parsing, generation) is
validated; the 0.5B model's judgement is not. Re-validate this
specifically once a judge model can actually run on the uni PC GPU.

A SECOND ISSUE THIS SURFACED, RELEVANT TO THE REAL RUN SPECIFICALLY:
model.py's MODEL_NAME_TARGET ("meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B") is the BASE
model, not an instruct/chat checkpoint -- correct for the CPT decoder's
own phoneme-to-text generation task, which doesn't need chat-instruct
behaviour. But it means disable_adapter() reuse of the real decoder for
Option 5 judging (see next section) would run the zero-shot
"Respond in exactly this format" instruction through a non-instruct
base model, which is a much weaker setup for instruction-following
than a model actually tuned for it, on top of whatever capability
issues exist regardless of tuning. Recommendation for task #49: on the
uni PC, point classify_error() at a small but genuinely instruct-tuned
model dedicated to judging (e.g. Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, or even the
existing MODEL_NAME_DRYRUN Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct as a cheap second
pass) rather than disable_adapter()-ing the production base-Llama
decoder. disable_adapter() is still the right call when the underlying
model genuinely is instruct-tuned (true for MODEL_NAME_DRYRUN) -- it
just doesn't rescue a base model that was never instruct-tuned to begin
with.

WHY disable_adapter() WHEN A PEFT-WRAPPED MODEL IS PASSED IN
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Task #49 wires this module into dryrun.py, which already has a
tokenizer + LoRA-wrapped model loaded for the thing actually being
evaluated. Reusing that loaded model avoids a second multi-hundred-MB
download/load in a memory-constrained sandbox (see model.py's CPU_DTYPE
comment re: 3.8GiB RAM). But the LoRA adapter is either randomly
initialised (CPU dry run, no training yet) or trained for the decoder's
own task (real run) -- neither is what we want answering "what kind of
linguistic error is this", which is a generic instruction-following
task closer to the base instruct model's pretraining. peft's
PeftModel.disable_adapter() context manager runs the forward/generate
pass through the un-adapted base weights, so classify_error() uses it
whenever the passed-in model exposes it, and falls back to a plain
.generate() call otherwise (e.g. a bare AutoModelForCausalLM with no
adapter, as in this module's own standalone smoke test).
