P2T LoRA Decoder — Stage 3 Option 3: Grammar-Based Contextual Analysis
====================================================================
Implements "Option 3: Grammar-Based Context Analysis" from the "P2T
Three-Stage Error Analysis Framework" (P2T Error Pattern Analysis V1.pdf).
The framework names spaCy / Stanza / LanguageTool as candidate tools and
gives one worked example: "Yesterday I went home" -> "Yesterday I will go
home", labelled Contextual / Tense inconsistency.

WHAT THIS MODULE ACTUALLY CATCHES, AND WHAT IT DOESN'T (validated, not
assumed — 25 Jun 2026)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Before writing the rules below, I ran spaCy's en_core_web_sm against both
of the PDF's own running examples to see whether a context-aware grammar
check could resolve them automatically:

  "I see the problem"  vs  "I sea the problem"
      -> spaCy's statistical tagger tags "sea" as VERB/ROOT in this
         context, identical to "see". The parse is internally consistent
         either way. POS/dependency parsing CANNOT catch this case — it's
         a content-word (open-class) homophone, and the tagger leans on
         surrounding context to guess a plausible tag for any token,
         correct word or not. This needs Stage 3 Option 5 (LLM-based
         classification, see llm_judge.py), not grammar.

  "their is a cat"  (should be "there is a cat")
      -> spaCy tags "their" correctly as PRP$ (possessive pronoun) but
         assigns it dep_="nsubj" — a possessive determiner standing in
         as a clause subject. That's a hard violation: "their" is
         lexically restricted to the "poss" dependency role (it always
         modifies a following head noun) no matter what surrounds it.
         This is catchable, reliably, because the violation is a property
         of the closed-class word itself, not of statistical context.

The dividing line this revealed: closed-class function-word homophones
(determiners/pronouns/contractions — there/their/they're, your/you're,
its/it's, whose/who's, to/too/two) have a fixed, narrow set of legal
syntactic roles that holds regardless of context, so a dependency-role
mismatch is strong, low-risk evidence of a genuine contextual error.
Open-class content-word homophones (see/sea, meet/meat, sight/site, ...)
do not have this property — the tagger will happily rationalise either
spelling. So this module only ever fires on the closed-class list below;
everything else returns resolved=False and should be escalated to
Stage 3 Option 5.

A SECOND, NARROWER FINDING: not every closed-class homophone set actually
benefits from this method (validated 25 Jun 2026, after the first smoke
test surfaced 3 unexpected non-flags)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
THEIR/YOUR/ITS/MY/OUR/WHOSE work because forcing them into the wrong
slot (e.g. "their" as a clause subject) produces a dependency label
genuinely outside their one legitimate role ("poss"). Re-tested this
against "your is broken", "its is broken", "my is here", "our is
bigger", "whose is this here" — all correctly parse to nsubj/nsubjpass,
none of which is "poss", so all correctly flag. Confirmed not a fluke
specific to "their is a cat".

THERE/TOO/TWO do NOT share this property, despite also being
closed-class. Tested "I left there book", "I went too the shop", "I
have too books", "I went two the shop", "too is broken": in every case
spaCy's parser falls back to the SAME dependency label it would assign
the word when used correctly (THERE -> advmod attaching to the nearest
verb, TOO -> advmod attaching to the nearest verb, TWO -> nummod
attaching to the nearest following noun) *regardless of whether that
usage is actually grammatical*. E.g. "too is broken" -- nonsensical,
"too" can't be a sentence subject -- still parses as advmod(broken),
never forced into a genuinely mismatched label the way "their is a
cat" forces THEIR into nsubj. The parser effectively has nowhere else
to put these three words, so a dep-role check can't distinguish correct
from incorrect usage for them. THERE/TOO/TWO are therefore EXCLUDED
from _VALID_DEPS below: keeping them would silently overclaim a
detection capability that doesn't exist for this word class. Real
their/your/its/my/our/whose-type errors: catchable here. Real
there/too/two-type errors: must escalate to Stage 3 Option 5.

WHY OPERATE ON THE ORIGINAL SENTENCE, NOT THE JIWER-NORMALISED ONE
--------------------------------------------------------------------
error_analysis.py's normalise() strips punctuation (re.sub(r"[^\w\s]",
"", text)) before word-alignment, which deletes apostrophes. That's fine
for alignment, but it means "IT'S" and "ITS" collapse to the identical
string "ITS" by the time classify_substitution() sees them — exactly the
distinction this module exists to resolve. So check_grammar() below is
designed to be called with the ORIGINAL (un-normalised) hypothesis
sentence, recovering the apostrophe'd word at the same whitespace-split
index, not the alignment-time normalised one.
